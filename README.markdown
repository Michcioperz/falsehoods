My ultimate competition: what programming language, compiler, optimizer
and what-not can give me the smolest (and therefore cutest) /bin/false.

Some requirements:
 - it should always exit with non-zero code (preferably 1)
 - it shouldn't print anything
 - it should be smol
 - it should be a binary, not a script, and preferably static

Some would say this is a flawed approach to cute, but I have heard since
like forever that tall men are naturally drawn to short women yadda
yadda.

I just like my /bin/false smol, so there's that.

The results are not ready anyhow at all, though I'm kinda impressed by
Crystal so far.

If you have better ideas how to do things, or you think that I've been
unjust to one of the contestants, please channel your concerns to me
over whichever way you fancy, be it messaging Michcioperz on freenode,
or messaging @Michcioperz@m.atm.pl on the fediverse, or emailing
public+falsehoods@meekchopp.es
